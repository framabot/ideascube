# Upstream dbus-python is not pip-installable:
#     https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55439
#
# So there is a fork on Github that **only** makes it pipi-installable:
#     https://github.com/posborne/dbus-python
#
# But that's for the master branch... which we can't use, because our Travis
# CI base is Ubuntu 12.04, which has DBus 1.4.18, and dbus-python master
# requires DBus >= 1.6.
#
# So we forked the forked, backporting the pip-related patches to the 1.1.1
# branch, and we use that here.

# Upstream isn't compatible with Django 1.10, and they are taking a long time
# to merge in a fix.
#     https://github.com/kelvinwong-ca/django-select-multiple-field/issues/12
#
# So we forked, and took the branch someone had submitted as a pull request.

# The latest releases are giving us trouble. Version 2.0.0 is a full rewrite,
# which seems to have broken compatibility with the old NetworkManager on
# Debian Jessie.
#
# Git master has a patch to restore compatibility:
#     https://github.com/seveas/python-networkmanager/commit/cad4dc79efd8d29e9fe1f1cd03f76e61534af808
#
# However, even with that applied we still seem to encounter issues. So for
# now, we've decided to stick with the older version.

# We do not directly depend on html5lib-python but bleach does.
# However the published "pre-release" of html5lib declares a dependency to
# setuptools and we don't want it.
# So until https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python/issues/328 is fixed
# we directly use the master branch of html5lib-python. Sadly :/
